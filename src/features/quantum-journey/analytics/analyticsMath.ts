// small, independently testable functions computed fresh from real data,
// never a separately mutable running total.

// Consistency% — the percentage of days, since the user's very first real
// session, that they've actually shown up. Deliberately NOT "days active
// in the last 7" (computeWeeklyActivity's own narrower window) — this is a
// lifetime figure spanning the whole journey so far. A user who joined
// today and practiced today is 100% consistent; one who joined 10 days
// ago and has 3 sessions is 30%, honestly.
