    text: 'The Mind Ur Mind App is built around three core pillars of mental training: Reading, Memory, and Focus. Reading exercises train your eyes and brain to process text faster while still understanding it deeply. Memory exercises strengthen your ability to recall names, numbers, and details under pressure. Focus exercises build the concentration needed to stay locked onto a single task without drifting. Together, these three pillars form a complete daily workout for the mind, the same way a gym workout trains different muscle groups on different days.',

    text: `The ${programs.focusStarter.appName} is structured in three distinct weeks, each with its own focus. Week 1 concentrates on foundational eye movements and quick Brain Gym drills, building the basic habits needed before moving to harder skills. Week 2 expands into Right-Brain activation and visualization exercises, layered alongside real reading sprints of growing length. Week 3 brings everything together at an advanced pace, introducing Intuition training for the first time and pushing reading speed further using an adaptive pacing system that adjusts to each person’s own real comprehension results, rather than a one-size-fits-all target.`,

    text: 'Many reading apps report a raw words-per-minute number without checking whether the reader actually understood anything, which can be misleading — skimming quickly without comprehension isn’t genuine reading skill. the Mind Ur Mind App instead calculates a "True WPM": your raw reading pace discounted by how much of the passage you actually understood, based on real comprehension questions answered right after reading. If you read at high speed but answer questions poorly, your True WPM reflects that honestly instead of inflating your score. This is meant to keep training grounded in real skill rather than a number that looks impressive but doesn’t reflect genuine ability.',

    text: 'A common problem with fixed daily curriculums is that they treat every learner identically, regardless of where each person is genuinely struggling. The Mind Ur Mind App addresses this through Smart Weakness Targeting, a system that quietly tracks real accuracy across the Intuition, Right Brain, and Visualisation domains behind the scenes, without ever interrupting the flow of a normal session. If a learner’s recent accuracy in one of these domains drops to a genuinely low level across multiple real attempts — not just one unlucky round, which could simply be bad luck — the system responds by swapping the next day’s warm-up exercise for a targeted drill in that specific weak area, clearly labeled so the learner understands exactly why that exercise was chosen for them. Crucially, this targeting respects the journey’s own weekly structure: a learner struggling with Intuition during Week 1 or Week 2 will not suddenly see Zener Card exercises appear early, since those weeks are deliberately reserved for foundational and expansion content. Instead, weakness signals are stored and only acted upon once the learner reaches the week where that particular skill is genuinely part of the curriculum. This design reflects a broader philosophy: real personalization should adapt to a learner’s actual demonstrated performance, not a guess, and it should never come at the cost of a coherent, trustworthy structure the learner can rely on.',
