// (dotMemoryGridEngine.ts, numberFlashGridEngine.ts): the vocabulary is
// open-ended (26 possible words, not a closed 0-9 set), so unlike digits
// — which are cheap enough to always offer all 10 as picker options —
// words need their own scoped picker: the round's own target words plus a
// handful of decoys drawn from the rest of the bank, not the entire bank
// every time.
