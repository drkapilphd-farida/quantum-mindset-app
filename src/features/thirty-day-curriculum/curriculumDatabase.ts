// 30-Day Quantum Speed Reading Mastery Curriculum™ — the day-by-day
// roadmap. Exercise SELECTION is mechanical (continuous pool rotation,
// see buildCurriculumDayPlan below) so every catalog exercise is
// guaranteed to appear and every gated module's real internal order is
// preserved automatically; day THEMES below are hand-written narrative
// framing only, the same split the 21-Day Quantum Journey already uses
// (algorithmic pool rotation + hand-authored narrative). A learner who
// completes every day in order will touch every one of the 57 catalog
// exercises at least once, and will always meet a sequentially-gated
// module's exercises (Eye Foundation, Reading Expansion, Flash
// Intelligence) in that module's own real prerequisite order.
