// 30-Day Quantum Speed Reading Mastery Curriculum™ — client-only
// (localStorage) progress engine. Deliberately separate from the
// existing 21-Day Quantum Journey's Supabase-backed tables/components —
// this feature never reads or writes journey_baseline_diagnostics or any
// `daily_quantum_sessions` row, so the two features can never collide.
//
// Day-unlocking here is genuinely sequential (day N unlocks only once
// day N-1 is marked complete), unlike the 21-Day Journey's
// paywall-only `isDayUnlocked` — see ThirtyDayCurriculumOverview.tsx for
// where this is enforced in the UI. `isDevUnlockEnabled()` — the same
// platform-wide dev/test bypass every other gated flow already uses
// (Reading Hub sequences, the 21-Day Journey's own Pro gate, etc.) —
// additionally unlocks all 30 days for launch-day testing/review,
// evaluating true only in local development or when a real deployment
// deliberately opts in via NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_UNLOCK; production users keep
// the real sequential gate.

// exception the way it used to be. The sequential "day N needs day N-1
// complete" structure is kept underneath that gate, for a paying
// learner — this isn't a change to the program's pacing design, only to
// who can enter it at all.
//
// Permanent access fix (see the "Fix 30-Day Curriculum Pricing +
// Permanent Day Access" task) — this used to re-derive "unlocked" from
// "isPro && (day 1 || previous day complete)" on every check, with no
// path that short-circuited for a day already completed. That meant
// access to an already-finished day silently depended on isPro staying
// true forever after — if a Pro check ever returned false for any
// reason (subscription lapsed, a stale/failed re-fetch, isDevUnlockEnabled
// toggling off between sessions, etc.), EVERY day re-locked at once,
// including Day 1 and every other already-completed day, because the
// `!isPro` check ran before the sequential logic ever got a chance to
// matter. Access is now a one-way, permanent flag per day: once a day is
// in completedDays, it returns true unconditionally, before isPro is
// even consulted — re-practicing a completed day never depends on
// current subscription status or where the learner is in the sequence
// today. Only entering a NEW day for the first time still requires real
// Pro access and the previous day's completion.
