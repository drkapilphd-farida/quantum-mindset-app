// Smart Exit & Auto-Advance™ — the single function every "back to the
// lab index" call site across the exercise catalog gets wrapped with, so
// an exercise opened as part of an active Daily Session Playlist returns
// the learner to the curriculum (and advances the playlist) instead of
// dumping them at the generic lab root. Every wrapped call site falls
// back to its ORIGINAL, unchanged destination whenever there is no
// active session, or the active session's current exercise isn't this
// one (e.g. the learner opened this exercise directly, outside the
// curriculum) — zero behavior change for non-curriculum usage.
//
// Two variants, because the shared engines this wraps distinguish two
// real cases:
//   - "smart exit" — an early abandon (Escape key, explicit mid-exercise
//     Exit button) — ends the whole playlist rather than silently
//     crediting a skipped exercise as done.
//   - "smart complete" — the natural "you're finished, back to lab"
//     action — advances the playlist to the next exercise, or, on the
//     final exercise, marks the day complete and returns to the day
//     view with a celebration flag.
// A number of simpler exercise engines collapse both cases into one
// button/call site; those are wrapped with the "complete" variant, since
// that call site is only reachable after the exercise's own completion
// screen renders (never a genuine mid-session cancel) — see each batch
// edit's own file for the specific reasoning.
