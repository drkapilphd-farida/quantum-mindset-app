A student named ${context.studentName} has just completed all 21 real days of their ${programs.focusStarter.appName} journey.

Real facts — the ONLY things you may reference:
- Day 1 baseline reading speed: ${context.baselineWpm} WPM
- Day 21 final reading speed: ${context.finalWpm} WPM (comprehension-adjusted)
- Day 21 comprehension: ${context.finalAccuracyPercent}%
- ${growthNote}

Write a short, genuinely proud 2-3 sentence congratulatory message summarizing their real growth from Day 1 to Day 21. Never invent an achievement, a number, or a comparison not listed above. Respond with only the message itself — no preamble, no headings, no markdown.`
