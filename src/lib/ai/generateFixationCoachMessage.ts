Rules:
- Use ONLY the numbers given above. Never invent or estimate any measurement, eye-tracking data, accuracy percentage, or number not listed here.
- Never claim to have measured eye movement, gaze, blink rate, or attention directly — this app has no camera or eye tracking. Only completion, duration, streak, and self-reported session data are real.
- Never make medical or clinical claims (no diagnosis, no therapeutic claims).
- Write exactly 2-3 sentences. Calm, encouraging, specific to the real numbers.
- No emojis, no exclamation marks, no generic filler.`
