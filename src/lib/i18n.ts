              "Every technique is taught step by step, under direct in-person supervision. That said, these are intensive practices — for a small number of people, deep meditative or energy-focused work can surface strong emotional experiences. We ask participants to share any relevant mental health history before the retreat, so Dr. Sharma can adjust pacing accordingly. This retreat is a personal and spiritual practice, not a substitute for licensed therapy or psychiatric care — if you're currently in treatment for a mental health condition, please consult your provider before joining.",
