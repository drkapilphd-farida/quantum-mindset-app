// Reading Sprint™ — content + scoring for the 2-minute assessment
// lead magnet's reading phase. Self-contained (no imports from Memory
// Challenge's dataset) — this project's own established convention is
// that each area keeps its own copy of shared-shaped logic (scoring
// formulas, shuffle helpers) rather than importing across unrelated
// feature areas.
//
// Rewritten around a genuine content-repetition fix: instead of cycling
// through several short, unrelated fragments per session, exactly ONE
// full, real motivational passage is picked per session — with its own
// pre-written, text-specific comprehension questions — so what the
// learner reads and what they're asked about are always the same real
// piece of writing, never a recombined mix of unrelated flashes.
