//                    the text (a real word-by-word flash, not a "chunk
//                    of size 1" that's actually the start of a sentence
//                    the eye keeps re-reading).
//   2. 2-word chunk — the next ~25% of the text.
//   3. 3-word chunk — the next ~20% of the text.
//   4. Phrase       — the remaining ~20%, grouped into ~5-word phrases —
//                    never the original full sentence.
// A group is cut short (never merged across the boundary) whenever the
// word it just consumed ends a sentence, so a flashed group never reads
// as two unrelated sentence fragments stitched together. Every word in
// the source text appears in exactly one stage, in order — the four
// phases partition the passage, they don't re-show any of it.
